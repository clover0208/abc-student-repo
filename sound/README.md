## Intro
This is a chrome extension that transfrom your webpage into a MIDI controller. Hightlight each alphabet(A,B,etc..) can make a melody or a bet. For anyone who love music, try this extension as a form of making or generating music through a webpage. There are also some words(Love, and music) that already form a music piece. Highlight on these words and express and feel the love and music through the music. You can also add some beat by highlighting other alphabet. This webpage will make you feel you are a DJ playing and performing through your MIDI controller. The text also have the bouncing effect, like the visual element cooperating with the sound element.

## Technical explanation
In this project, I used the load audio file and the split of span tag and the mouseup down function. The first challenge I faced is that I was trying to make each character bounce, however, the process was too slow so I turn to make the word bounce. For future improvement, I will add more animation and movement to the text. The second challenge I faced is the composition of each music or audio file played when which letter is selected. I will explore more on the music piece.
