## Description
This is a project aiming at building a DNA exists in the web.
It control the shape of the creatures and can build creatures.
I believe each website has it's own soul and in my project, I utilize this form(DNA) to reveal its' life to people who visit this website
## Shortcomings
Because of lack of time, I didn't managed to design the creatures very well. I will work further on how the creatures
may looks like. But also I am interested in making the sliders moving so it seems like the DNA is forming. Like the life of this website is forming.Please come back some time later(maybe during winter).
