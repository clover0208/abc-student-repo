AWhat I found interesting in Lialina’s page is the wall paper she’s using. It reminds me of the old home decoration I saw when I visited Europe. I also searched some old webpages they created and their new pages in some aspect looks similar with the old one. Penny Juice is still colorful but the slightly more complex layout makes it looks modern. Arngren, an old website makes me think of Taobao’s layout and the only difference may be their css style. Compared to modern website, the old ones are simple, direct and have their own beauty in it. The transition of the website make me think of the changing comic style in an animation I watched before. Website styles just keep growing fancy but sometimes I just missed the simple and nostalgic style in my childhood.

For the differences between Lialina’s description and my childhood memories, the website I saw is more plain or black and white compared with the fancy or colorful website Lialina showed. For most of the times, the website has no background and the information are all arranged in order like a manual for you to read.

Another thing appeals to me is that most of the old webpages and files (MIDI) can’t be opened anymore. The MIDI file I downloaded can’t be open by QuickTime or iTunes. They are like old memories fading away. Also, when I entered an old website(Arngren)’s url to W3C, it returns 1000 errors or warnings. It’s interesting to see how the old website are coded differently compared with nowadays website.
